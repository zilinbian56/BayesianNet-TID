Traffic Incident Duration Prediction using Bayesian Network
This is an example code demonstrating how to use Bayesian network to predict non-recurrent traffic incident duration.
The data used for training, validation and testing is one-year crash records within New York City.
Credentials about each incident were hidden, the values are pre-converted into dummy variables for easy training effort.
